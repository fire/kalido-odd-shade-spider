## VRM Vtuber Template as an Electron Application

Work in progress.

Kalidokit is a blendshape and kinematics solver for Mediapipe/Tensorflow.js face, eyes, pose, and hand tracking models, compatible with [Facemesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/face-landmarks-detection), [Blazepose](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/pose-detection), [Handpose](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html), and [Holistic](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/holistic.html). It takes predicted 3D landmarks and calculates simple euler rotations and blendshape face values.

As the core to Vtuber web apps, [Kalidoface](https://kalidoface.com) and [Kalidoface 3D](https://3d.kalidoface.com), KalidoKit is designed specifically for rigging 3D VRM models and Live2D avatars!
